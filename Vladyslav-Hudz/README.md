# Arduino - Get Started Guide

This document will provide you with the initial instructions for using Arduino and getting started with the platform.

## Requirements

Before getting started, you will need:

- An Arduino board
- A computer with Arduino IDE installed
- A USB cable to connect Arduino to the computer

## Step 1: Installing Arduino IDE

1. Visit the official Arduino website at [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/).
2. Download the Arduino IDE from the "Downloads" page.
3. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer by following the instructions for your operating system.

## Step 2: Connecting Arduino

1. Connect Arduino to your computer using the USB cable.
2. Launch the Arduino IDE.

## Step 3: Selecting the Board and Port

1. In the `Menu Bar` in the `Tools` menu, select the appropriate Arduino board under `Board`.
2. Choose the correct `Port` for your Arduino board in the `Tools` menu. If you're unsure which port to select, refer to the documentation specific to your board.
