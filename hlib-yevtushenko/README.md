> ## **4. Additional Features**
<br />

Telegram offers several additional features and functionalities that enhance your messaging experience. Here are a few notable features:

* **Channels**: Channels in Telegram allow users to broadcast messages to a large audience. Unlike group chats, channels typically have one or more administrators who post messages, and users can subscribe to receive updates. Channels are often used for news, announcements, or community discussions.

* **Voice and Video Calls**: Telegram supports voice and video calls, allowing you to have real-time audio and video conversations with your contacts. To make a call, open a chat with the contact, tap on the phone or camera icon at the top of the screen, and select the desired option.

* **Secret Chats**: Secret Chats are end-to-end encrypted conversations that provide an extra layer of privacy and security. Messages in secret chats can self-destruct, and they are not stored on Telegram's servers. To start a secret chat, go to the chat list, tap on the pencil icon, and select "New Secret Chat."

* **File Sharing and Cloud Storage**: Telegram allows you to share files of various types and sizes. You can send documents, photos, videos, and other files directly within the app. Additionally, Telegram offers cloud storage, where you can store and access files, photos, and videos in your Telegram account.

* **Bots**: Telegram supports chatbots, which are automated programs that can interact with users and provide various services. Bots can be used for tasks such as news delivery, weather updates, language translation, games, and more. You can find and interact with bots by searching for their usernames or accessing bot directories.

* **Customization and Themes**: Telegram provides options to customize your app's appearance. You can change the theme, chat backgrounds, and font size to personalize your Telegram experience. To access these customization options, follow these steps:

1. Open the Telegram app on your device.
2. Tap on the menu icon (usually represented by three horizontal lines) in the top-left corner of the screen to open the side menu.
3. Scroll down and select "Settings."
4. In the Settings menu, you will find various customization options. Here are a few examples:
   * **Theme**: Tap on "Chat Settings" or "Appearance," then select "Theme." Choose between the available light and dark themes or enable the auto theme that adjusts based on your device's settings.
   * **Chat Background**: In the "Chat Settings" or "Appearance" section, you can select "Chat Background" to change the background of your chats. Choose from preloaded backgrounds or use a custom photo from your device's gallery.
   * **Font Size**: Under "Chat Settings" or "Appearance," you can adjust the font size to make text more comfortable to read. Choose from small, medium, large, or extra-large font sizes.
   * **Notification Settings**: Customize how you receive notifications for messages, calls, and other activities. You can adjust sound, vibration, and other notification preferences in the "Notifications and Sounds" section.
   * **Language**: Telegram supports multiple languages. In the Settings menu, tap on "Language" and select your preferred language from the available options.

> ## **5. Privacy and Security**
<br />

Telegram prioritizes user privacy and security and offers several features to protect your data and conversations. Here are some privacy and security options available in Telegram:

* **End-to-End Encryption**: Secret Chats in Telegram feature end-to-end encryption, meaning only you and the recipient can read the messages. Telegram's server does not have access to the content of these chats. It's important to note that regular chats and group chats do not have end-to-end encryption by default.

* **Two-Step Verification**: Telegram provides an additional layer of security through two-step verification. You can set up a password that will be required when logging in to your Telegram account on a new device. To enable two-step verification, go to the Settings menu, tap on "Privacy and Security," and select "Two-Step Verification."

* **Passcode Lock**: You can add a passcode lock to the Telegram app to prevent unauthorized access. This is different from two-step verification and acts as an app lock. To set up a passcode lock, go to the Settings menu, tap on "Privacy and Security," and select "Passcode Lock."

* **Data Self-Destruction**: In Secret Chats, you can enable self-destructing messages. You can set a timer for how long the messages will be available before they automatically disappear from both devices. To enable self-destruction, open a Secret Chat, tap on the contact's name, and select "Self-Destruct Timer."

* **Blocking and Reporting**: If you encounter unwanted or abusive users on Telegram, you can block them to prevent them from contacting you. Open the chat with the user you want to block, tap on their name or profile picture, and select "Block User." You can also report abusive content or users to Telegram's support team.

Telegram's focus on privacy and security provides users with control over their data and conversations. However, it's essential to remain vigilant and cautious while interacting with others online.
