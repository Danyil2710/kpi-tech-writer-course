# Greating and general info

Hello! My name is Oleh Koliada and in this file I want to tell a couple of words about how to use DI.FM - site for listening radios, channel stations and different
playlists.

# Home page and search bar

First of all, when you enter the site, the first thing you will see is home page with different categories of radio stations, channel stations and playlists.
There, you can just scrole down to find what u want to listen. 

There is also a search bar on this page where you can write down the name of radio station or playlist you are looking for. Then just press enter to start a
searching and you will get the similar page to the home one on which there will be results of searching according to your request.

In borth cases, to start listening all you need to do is just click on playlist/radio station/channel station and in the new window click "play" button.

Thats the basic knowlege you need to start using DI.FM. And thats all for today. Thanks for your attention ^^)
