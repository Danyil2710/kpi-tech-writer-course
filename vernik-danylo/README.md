## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository 

`git clone https://github.com/DanyaVer/ai-reading-exam.git`

2. Navigate to cloned folder

`cd ai-reading-exam`

3. Install dependencies

`npm install`

4. Start the app in your local environment

`npm start`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Play

1. Open [this link](https://a672-212-90-50-156.ngrok-free.app/) with demo of this SPA (single page application) to test. Although, it might be deactivated due to the black-out in Kyiv and shut down of my PC.
<br />

2. Write a sequence of words (you can reset the written sequence by clicking on the icon button on the right of the input field) and press the "Generate" button, which will invoke the generateText() function. This function sends an API request to the `/complete` endpoint of the Jurassic-1 Grande model. The main request includes a "one shot" `prompt` parameter with a value that prompts the model to generate a new made-up text related to words. Other parameters worth noticing are `maxTokens`, `temperature`, and `stopSequences`.
<br />

3. Once the model returns a response, it is rendered below the Input Field and "Generate" button as text with latin letters prior to each paragraph.
<br />

4. Then you can see two buttons below: "Headings" and "True/False/Not given". When clicked, each shows tasks for the module it represents. Every sentence there is generated for one paragraph which is used in prompt value in another two API request to Jurassic-1 Grande.
<br />

5. After answering these questions, you can click the "Submit" button and it'll check your answers, color every select object either as correct or wrong one, and in the bottom will be created two additional lines with results for each category.
